            <h1>General Goals & SMART Goals</h1>
            <h3>SMART Goals</h3>
            <p>Specific | Measurable | Achieveable | Relevant | Time-bound</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="orange">Improve Proper Counter-Strafing,from 79% to 85%, in 2 months, Practise in FFA Deathmatch and focus on making sure you are standing completely still for every single kill</li>
                <li class="orange">Improve Crosshair Placement, from 11.6 to 11, in 2 months, Practise in YPrac Prefire maps focus on memorizing all the common positions and put that same motions in real games.</li>
                <li class="red">Decrease Unused Utility On Death, from $383.7 to 300, in 1 month, Start Focusing on round timings and studying when you think the enemy is going to execute or try a play in order to effectively use your utility throughout the round in order to delay and damage them.</li>
                <li class="orange">Increase Flash Blind Duration per Flash Enemy, from 2.77 sec to 2.9, in 1.5 months, learn common pop flashes for teammates and implement them during your games to have more effective flashes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>General Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stop dying from rushes</li>
                <li>Stop dying to Awpers</li>
                <li>Stop accidentally over-peeking angles</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When taking fights or clearing angles do so like you are expecting an enemy there every time also, practise proper pre-aiming and crosshair placement whenever taking engagements as well as proper counter-strafing, this will win you a lot more fights.</li>
                <li>Make sure you have enough ammo for your next fight, a simple way to check that is to look at your leetify stats (Spray accuracy) if it is 40% you need to have a minimum of 9 bullets with an AK or M4 before you take a fight, if it is 30% minimum of 10 bullets.</li>
                <li>Trust your instincts for example, if you know you have a bad spawn don’t take the shot, if you think you got a timing go for it, by trusting your instincts and reacting off of them this will allow your gamesence to be constantly tested and while its getting tested it will get better significantly faster than if you were to play completely safe.</li>
                <li>Learn between 4-7 spots on every site for the Active duty map pool, learn what kind of fights you usually take when in those spots, what weapons excel in those positions and what weapons don't, what utility can I drop, how far away can the enemy head me reload and jump from this spot, where can I fall back to.</li>
                <li>learn protocols (Rules) for those positions (For example, if I get flashed, I will drop this smoke, if I just spot and see 2 enemies I will drop this molly) basic protocols, by having a minimum of 4 spots this will allow you to switch things up and if you are getting countered in 1 spot you can switch it up, as well as being unpredictable.</li>
                <li>Play other maps, other than Cache and this is because getting to used to playing on 1 map will leave you fantastic on that 1 map, but then your overall skills won’t transfer to other maps like crosshair placement and preaiming, in order to evenly increase these skills throughout all maps you need to play them as well, I can see from your Matches you play a lot of cache, but hardly any, Dust2 / Nuke / Overpass / Vertigo</li>
                <li>Play the vast majority of games as long matches and this is because in short matches, CS:GO is almost an entirely different game, rounds are quicker and utility doesn’t matter as much, and playing too many short games will negatively effect how you play long games, I recommend a balance of 6-1, for every 6 long games, you can play 1 short match.</li>

                <h3>FFA DeathMatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crouching too much, over-reliance on it bringing down your spray instead of moving it down with your mouse.</li>
                    <li>Flicking away before the kill on the enemy is confirmed</li>
                    <li>Jumping randomly</li>
                    <li>Playing out in the open often over exposing yourself to multiple angles</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, solid callouts and quick rotation from B up short to A, nice opening kill on the enemy goose and then the second kill on the enemy going overly agro short to kill you, although when faced in the 2v1 you went in with low ammo and over exposed yourself to both angles and died. L</li>
                    <li>Five Seven buy,  good information and very nice rotate through long which allowed you to catch 2 enemy on the site. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, when crossing middle you did dangerously as an enemy suicide could have tagged you, I recommend crossing closer to door to still get the information but not be exposed as much and for as long, solid kill on the enemy on site but spray was slightly off and panicked but you managed to get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous cross again but this time you got tagged for 54 while crossing, interesting push into tunnels could have ended badly as flash and movement through the smoke wasn’t the cleanest but fortunately there was no-one there to catch you, nice rotate to long allowed you to catch the enemy car, but unfortunate timing and positioning long caused you to get flashed while out in the open and have no place to hide. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle buy, nice call on the enemies coming up cat, unfortunate miss on the enemy pushing door but with your lag it was a harder kill than it would have on your own servers. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad positioning and unexpected rush nearly caused you to die to the first enemy pushing out B, and if more had followed you would have been caught off-guard I recommend changing your protocols on B to something more sustainable during rushes, when saving outside tunnels use your positional advantage to catch the enemies off-guard instead of jiggle peeking into tunnels. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good attempt at fighting long but bad timing on the flash peek caused you to take the fight against 3 enemies peeking long not blind, but good adjustment to manage to get 1 kill in the situation, but you did good damage to the other 2. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, slight movement fail during the boost but you understood immediately but nothing to worry about, changing positions between B and long constantly it looked like you were very uncomfortable and overly exposed and sometimes throwing random utility when its a 4v2. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good attempt at communicating a flash peek long which worked but unfortunately changing target halfway through an engagement made the adjustment much more difficult than hiding and then repeeking long again, also when peeking long you peeked very wide exposing yourself to everyone out long and in long house. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning gandalf although unconventional worked successfully in preventing the bomb from going down and you managed to secure 3 kills. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, interesting aggression up middle although smoke was quite dangerous and could have been thrown more safely, you were not punished and you got valuable information, unfortunately while dropping your molly your positioning was very exposed and this allowed the 1 enemy that got out tunnels to shoot at you and kill you, try dropping utility quicker and from behind cover and always hide immediately after dropping utility and pulling out your weapon. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good long molly, but corner position is not optimal with a rifle and the jiggle prefire is quite dangerous if not done correctly as it exposes your body and allows the enemy to predict when you will peek again, nice rotate to a position not covered and this allowed you to catch an enemy running up catwalk completely off-guard. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice molly long, although I would have recommended a faster rotate to short once you saw your short player had died, good play from elevator getting a solid double headshot kill, unfortunately, you peeked and died without enough ammo, you should always focused on having enough ammo for every engagement you take this is the third time you have peeked this game and run out of ammo causing your death. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid long take again but dangerous peek into long house allowed the enemy to have the advantage in that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Acknowledged you didn’t have the right spawn for the long molly and went for it anyways and ended up getting punished for it. L</li>
                    <li>T pistol armour, good attempts at calling a strat, unfortunately with no-one holding middle an enemy pushed into middle and managed to kill 3 of you running out lowers. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, short rush, good job getting the bomb down and good understanding and movement in order to crouch and dodge some bullets. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good job pushing up to site and solid crosshair placement, solid entry kill onto site, but positioning from teammates could have been better. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, pushing into middle and pushing up short solo was dangerous as you had no one to trade with you and no utility usage when peeking short, also when peeking into short it wasn’t a focused peek it was very wide and erratic crosshair movements instead of it being locked onto the next most likely angle this made it very difficult for you to win the fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good flash long for teammates entrying, solid acknowledgement to cover positions your teammates were not covering, unfortunately the enemy did a pretty good play pushing through the smoke when he heard you were falling back to long. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, teammates were griefing and not letting you fall back long forcing you out, but you managed to get a solid kill on the enemy long corner and good damage on the second, unfortunately movement when going onto A site caused you to jump and this let the enemy kill you without you being able to shoot back. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good attempt at trading your teammate lowers but unfortunately you wiffed while spraying him down, and teammates were trolling. L</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you during that game? <br> First half yes, was quite comforatble, but after the second half came, made a couple of mistakes which could have caused the tides to shift.</li>
                    <li>How did your crosshair placement feel? <br> Not so good </li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel?  <br> Some-what on point</li>
                    <li>How did your overall aim mechanics feel? <br> overall pretty comfortable but over-committing to fights</li>
                    <li>How did your movement feel? <br> CT side, pretty decent, but T side felt bad </li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> Did not use flashes very well long. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel? <br> No, also the team was not communictaing anything. </li>
                    <li>Did you get along with your teammates, would you like to play with any of them again? <br> No </li>
                    <li>Looking back now what do you think you could immediately improve on for the next game? <br> Use flashes better and not queue for EU servers</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
